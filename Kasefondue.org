* Käsefondue Savoyarde
This is for two and a half persons and the combination of cheeses is suggested by our local Cheese Shop, [[https://www.google.fr/maps/place/LE+CELLIER+A+FROMAGES+MARIE+MONTINI/@48.571492,1.9043159,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e42fb219854b8d:0x7b58253db8fa4f86][Le Cellier A Fromages]], by Marie Montini.

To work best, you need a cast iron or ceramic pot as otherwise the heat is to much concentrated in the center where the burner is.

** Recipe
- 500 gr cheese (200 per person) (e.g. 1 part Comté, 2 parts Vacherain, two parts third forgotten)

cut in small pieces or grate

- 250 ml dry white wine (e.g. Riesling)
- 1 clove garlic (squashed or cut or ...)

heat up and add cheese slowly - *stirring continuously!*

- 1 tbsp Speisestärke
- 2 tbsp wine

mix together and add to the wine / cheese mix.

The temperature should not be cold (no bubbling) or to hot (lot's of bubbling). Just about bubbling a bit.

Again: when eating, stir with the forks!

Enjoy.
